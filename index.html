    <h1 class = "heading">Happy Birthday!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</h1>
    <p>Heyy my EMPRESS, hehehe, I didn't wanna send my wishes in a flat way but a kinda unique? Definitely unique way and MY way. OKAY FIRST THINGS FIRST. HAPPY BIRTHDAY, YOU'RE 18. FINALLY I won't be a paedophile anymore. I feel so guilty of not getting you any gift, but you never said what you wanted, so this is a mini gift I made you. IK it’s not the gift anyone would expect but I hope you liked the game. I really hope that all your wishes come true, all that you want you get and you can be your best, cause from the bottom of my heart you deserve it all and much much more. Friyana, the most interesting, lovely, sweet, angry, BEAUTIFUL, TIMID and INSANE person I have encountered. This birthday I wanna let you know how Amazing you are, were, and maybe always will be for me. Since the Day we have met till date you have changed my life in so many ways, I can call you my Saviour because you did save me from so many bs things i keep doing, the food we shared (Well just me eating your tiffin while mine was stolen but I digress), the sneaky times we had in school benches, the number of dirty jokes I made about you and literally everything we encountered. KITKATS, YES, EVERY FRICKING DAY, with you it never felt like school or anywhere we went, it always felt like home, while talking I just kept seeing you as my COMFORT place, a person who always loves me. Even the tiffin didn't seem like tiffin, it was A WHOLE MEAL, cause firstly short break was something light, then Heavy lunch (According to school standards, actual your type of heavy lunch would fill me up twice) and then ever a dessert, those were the best times. I had no fear in my chest, just love for you and anticipation of when I get to see you next, that anticipation is painful too, cause its so damn hard not to see you, it just kills me each day. Then your body, UFFFF that's just so smooth, I don't know why you judge your body so much, it’s like you are blind and don't see the perfection that I see, your eyes are mesmerizing, waist fits to flawlessly in my hand, and YES YOUR FINGERS ARE AMAZIG PLEASE STOP COMPLAINING ABOUT THEM, I LIKE THEM ALOTT. There are a few other aspects of you that I have explored and talked about a lot, so won't get into them but them are veryyy important too. Friyana, my 80’s child, YES YOU ARE A CHILD MANIER TIMES, hehe, BUT I love our mini song review we used to do me taking out the most minute details out of your songs, and you being the biggest song explorer have heard every song I throw at you, It was like magic, you could read me like an open book. From book I remember, SMUT, even tho I was a bit sceptical when we first met about your book choices but now I totally understand why you liked them. You have made me stronger either my love, hate or everything in the middle you have made me stronger and this phase of my life, you take the cake of being the EMPRESS OF MY LIFE. When you used to be a child with me I used to be the most happiest, the cutest child I can even imagine in a 18 year old lies within you and I fricking LUFFF IT So many times I acted out and wanted you to be irritated cause uff I have this guilty pleasure of seeing you irritated cause its cute many times but you take it serious then it dies out, but the initial irritation is the besssst. I could literally go on days and days talking about how amazing you are but for your and my sake it’s gotta be short for today. <br> Thank You for being a part in my life and giving me such great memories and this beautiful life to live in. I will always be available for you all you need is a call. I hope you enjoy your today and all the days ahead of you. I love you Darling!  </p>
